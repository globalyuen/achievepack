  "faq": {
    "q1": "Is Bio-PE compostable?",
    "a1": "No, Bio-PE is not compostable. It is chemically identical to conventional PE. The 'bio' refers to its renewable plant-based origin, not its end-of-life. Bio-PE is recyclable in standard PE recycling streams.",
    "q2": "What is the carbon benefit of Bio-PE?",
    "a2": "Sugarcane absorbs CO2 as it grows, making Bio-PE production carbon negative. Each ton of Bio-PE captures approximately 3.09 tons of CO2 from the atmosphere, compared to fossil PE which emits ~1.8 tons CO2 per ton produced.",
    "q3": "Does Bio-PE perform the same as regular PE?",
    "a3": "Yes, Bio-PE has identical properties to fossil-based PE including heat seal temperature, barrier properties, flexibility, and printing characteristics. It's a direct drop-in replacement.",
    "q4": "How much does Bio-PE cost compared to conventional PE?",
    "a4": "Bio-PE typically costs 15-30% more than fossil PE due to production scale and feedstock costs. However, prices continue to decrease as production capacity increases.",
    "q5": "What percentage of bio-based content is available?",
    "a5": "We can offer Bio-PE pouches with up to 95% bio-based content. For multi-layer structures, the bio-based percentage depends on which layers use Bio-PE. Typical options are 30%, 50%, or 95% bio-based."
