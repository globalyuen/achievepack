            "moq": {
                "q": "Can I really start with just 100 pouches?",
                "a": "Yes. Really. We work with everyone from weekend farmers' market vendors to established DTC brands. Whether you need 100 or 100,000, the quality is the same. Many of our 50,000+ piece clients started with us at 100. Low MOQs let you test with real customers before betting your whole budget."

                "q": "How long until I get my order?",
                "a": "Samples: 2-3 weeks. Full production: 6-8 weeks from approved artwork. Shipping: Air freight takes 7-10 days, sea freight 25-35 days. Need it faster? Talk to us—rush orders with 4-day sampling are sometimes possible."
            },
            "cost": {
                "q": "Will this cost way more than regular plastic?",
                "a": "More? Yes. Way more? No. Expect about 15-30% more than quality conventional packaging. But you'll save 15-22% on shipping (lighter materials), 70% on warehouse space (ships flat), and your customers will actually appreciate the investment. 73% say they'll pay more for sustainable brands—that's Nielsen, not us."
            },
            "barrier": {
                "q": "How do I know which barrier is right for my product?",
                "a": "Tell us what you're packing, and we'll recommend options. Coffee needs different protection than cookies. Powders need different seals than chips. Quick guide: LOW BARRIER = dry goods, 3-6 months. MEDIUM = snacks/coffee, 6-12 months. HIGH = pet treats, 12-18 months. MAXIMUM = freeze-dried, 18+ months. We've done this 500+ times—we'll point you right."
            },

                "q": "What if I don't have artwork ready?",
                "a": "No problem. We can connect you with designers, or you work with your own. We provide die-line templates in AI, PDF, or PSD format. Either way, we'll make sure everything is print-ready before production starts. Digital mockups and physical printed samples for color matching are included."
            },
            "colorConsistency": {
                "q": "Will my colors match across reorders?",
                "a": "Color consistency is everything for brand identity. We keep digital color references and physical samples from every production run. Pantone matching for plate printing. Pre-production proofs before each reorder. Our QC team uses calibrated spectrophotometers to measure color deviation—we're that serious about it."
            },
            "defects": {
                "q": "What if the pouches arrive damaged or defective?",
                "a": "Quality control is built into every production stage. But if something goes wrong, we have a clear returns policy. Send photos within 7 days of delivery, and we'll replace defective items. We test seal strength, zipper cycles, and burst pressure—most issues get caught before shipping."
            },
            "testReports": {
                "q": "Can I get documentation for compliance?",
                "a": "Yes—we provide everything you need: Food contact safety certificates (FDA, EU 10/2011), migration testing reports, OTR and WVTR data for shelf-life predictions, and compostability certificates with lab results. All in PDF format, ready to share with your compliance team or retail partners."
            },
            "verifyCertification": {
                "q": "How do I know if any supplier is actually certified?",
                "a": "Good question—here's what to check: Ask for actual certificate numbers (not just logos). Request test reports from accredited labs. Verify the certificate applies to the exact material you're ordering. Check if it covers the complete pouch (zipper, valve, everything). We provide all documentation upfront and welcome verification requests."
            },
            "switching": {
                "q": "What should I know before switching to recyclable pouches?",
                "a": "A few things: Barrier performance—mono-PE and mono-PP typically offer lower barrier than multi-layer. Recycling infrastructure varies by region (store drop-off in US, kerbside in some EU areas). Regulatory claims must comply with FTC Green Guides. We help navigate these trade-offs and can suggest alternatives if full recyclability isn't achievable yet."

                    "a2": "Compostable packaging requires oxygen and microbes to break down efficiently. Landfills are anaerobic environments (no oxygen), so decomposition is very slow. However, compostable materials will still break down faster than conventional plastics and won't leave microplastic residue.",

                    "a3": "Most certified compostable packaging is designed for commercial/industrial composting (55-60°C). Some materials are home compostable (certified to AS 5810 or OK Home standard). We can advise which materials suit your needs.",
                    "q4": "Is compostable packaging food safe?",
                    "a4": "Yes, all our compostable materials are certified for food contact under FDA 21 CFR and EU 10/2011 regulations. PLA and cellulose-based materials are derived from natural sources and are safe for direct food contact.",
                    "q5": "How much does compostable packaging cost compared to regular plastic?",
                    "a5": "Compostable materials typically cost 15-30% more than conventional plastic. However, as production scales and demand grows, the price gap is narrowing. Many brands find the sustainability benefits and marketing value justify the premium."

                    "a1": "Yes, our PCR materials are FDA approved for food contact. The recycled content undergoes advanced decontamination (super-cleaning) and rigorous testing to meet food safety standards including migration testing.",
                    "q2": "Does PCR affect print quality?",
                    "a2": "PCR may have slightly different optical properties (slight haze or color variation) compared to virgin plastic. At 30-50% PCR content, the impact on print quality is minimal. We recommend samples to evaluate appearance for your application.",
                    "q3": "What is the source of your PCR?",
                    "a3": "Our PCR comes from established post-consumer waste streams, primarily food-grade PET bottles and PE packaging. We work with certified recyclers who provide full traceability and use advanced sorting and cleaning processes.",
                    "q4": "How much does PCR packaging cost?",
                    "a4": "PCR typically costs 10-20% more than virgin plastic, though pricing fluctuates with recycled feedstock availability. The premium supports recycling infrastructure development and reflects the additional processing required.",
                    "q5": "Can PCR pouches still be recycled?",
                    "a5": "Yes, PCR pouches can be recycled again, continuing the circular economy loop. The recyclability depends on the overall pouch structure (mono-material vs multi-layer) rather than the PCR content itself."
