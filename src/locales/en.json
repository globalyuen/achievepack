                    "a2": "Compostable packaging requires oxygen and microbes to break down efficiently. Landfills are anaerobic environments (no oxygen), so decomposition is very slow. However, compostable materials will still break down faster than conventional plastics and won't leave microplastic residue.",

                    "a2": "Mono-PE offers medium barrier properties suitable for many dry goods. For products requiring higher barrier, we use EVOH-coated PE which maintains recyclability while improving oxygen barrier. MVTR typically 1-3 g/m²/24hr, OTR 10-30 cc/m²/24hr for standard PE.",
