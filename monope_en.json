  "faq": {
    "q1": "Is mono-PE truly recyclable?",
    "a1": "Yes, mono-PE pouches are recyclable in polyethylene recycling streams. They are accepted at store drop-off points (like those at major retailers) and some curbside programs. Always check local recycling guidelines.",
    "q2": "What is the barrier level of mono-PE?",
    "a2": "Mono-PE offers medium barrier properties suitable for many dry goods. For products requiring higher barrier, we use EVOH-coated PE which maintains recyclability while improving oxygen barrier. MVTR typically 1-3 g/m²/24hr, OTR 10-30 cc/m²/24hr for standard PE.",
    "q3": "How does mono-PE compare in cost?",
    "a3": "Mono-PE pouches typically cost 5-15% more than equivalent multi-material structures due to specialized materials needed for barrier. However, the sustainability benefit often justifies the premium for eco-conscious brands.",
    "q4": "Can mono-PE pouches be printed?",
    "a4": "Yes, mono-PE pouches can achieve high-quality printing with up to 10 colors. We use specialized inks and coatings designed for PE surfaces. Surface treatment ensures excellent ink adhesion."
