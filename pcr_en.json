  "faq": {
    "q1": "Is PCR packaging food safe?",
    "a1": "Yes, our PCR materials are FDA approved for food contact. The recycled content undergoes advanced decontamination (super-cleaning) and rigorous testing to meet food safety standards including migration testing.",
    "q2": "Does PCR affect print quality?",
    "a2": "PCR may have slightly different optical properties (slight haze or color variation) compared to virgin plastic. At 30-50% PCR content, the impact on print quality is minimal. We recommend samples to evaluate appearance for your application.",
    "q3": "What is the source of your PCR?",
    "a3": "Our PCR comes from established post-consumer waste streams, primarily food-grade PET bottles and PE packaging. We work with certified recyclers who provide full traceability and use advanced sorting and cleaning processes.",
    "q4": "How much does PCR packaging cost?",
    "a4": "PCR typically costs 10-20% more than virgin plastic, though pricing fluctuates with recycled feedstock availability. The premium supports recycling infrastructure development and reflects the additional processing required.",
    "q5": "Can PCR pouches still be recycled?",
    "a5": "Yes, PCR pouches can be recycled again, continuing the circular economy loop. The recyclability depends on the overall pouch structure (mono-material vs multi-layer) rather than the PCR content itself."
