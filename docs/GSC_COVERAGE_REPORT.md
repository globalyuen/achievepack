## Monitoring Checklist

### Manual Checks (Perform Monthly)

- [ ] Visit [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
- [ ] Check Coverage Report for errors
- [ ] Verify sitemap was successfully processed
- [ ] Review "Valid" vs "Valid with warnings" pages
- [ ] Check for "Excluded" pages and reasons
- [ ] Monitor "Crawl errors" section
- [ ] Verify mobile usability issues

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Coverage Status**
   - Valid pages indexed
   - Pages with warnings
   - Excluded pages
   - Error pages

2. **Indexing Progress**
   - New pages discovered
   - Pages indexed vs submitted
   - Time to index new content

3. **Issues to Watch**
   - Server errors (5xx)
   - Not found (404)
   - Redirect errors
   - Soft 404s
   - Duplicate content
   - Crawl anomalies

### Recommended Actions

**Weekly:**
- Review new coverage issues
- Check for sudden drops in indexed pages

**Monthly:**
- Run `npm run update:sitemap` to update lastmod dates
- Submit updated sitemap to Search Console
- Review and fix any persistent errors
- Analyze page performance in search results

**Quarterly:**
- Audit all SEO pages for content quality
- Update metadata and structured data
- Review internal linking strategy
- Optimize underperforming pages

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Discovered - currently not indexed"
**Cause:** Google found the page but hasn't indexed it yet
**Solution:** Improve page quality, add internal links, request indexing

### "Crawled - currently not indexed"
**Cause:** Page crawled but deemed low priority for indexing
**Solution:** Enhance content quality, add more value, increase authority

### "Duplicate without user-selected canonical"
**Cause:** Similar content without clear canonical tags
**Solution:** Add proper canonical tags, differentiate content

### "Soft 404"
**Cause:** Page returns 200 but appears to be an error page
**Solution:** Return proper 404 status or add more content

## Setup API Access (Optional)

For automated monitoring with real Google data:

```bash
# 1. Enable Search Console API
# Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/searchconsole.googleapis.com

# 2. Create Service Account
# Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts

# 3. Download credentials JSON
# Save as: gsc-service-account.json

# 4. Grant access in Search Console
# Visit: https://search.google.com/search-console
